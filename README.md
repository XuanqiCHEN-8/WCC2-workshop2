# Sync Balance Ball
Author:Xuanqi Chen

## Introduction
My project is a simple real-time game called Sync Balance. I used WebSockets to connect everyone to the same ball on the screen. 
When you click, you push the ball, but since everyone is playing at the same time, you are constantly reacting to what others 
are doing. I kept the visuals very basic—just a glowing ball and some data—because I want people to focus on the feeling of being 
connected to strangers. You can see how many people are online and which side is clicking more, but you can’t fully control the 
ball by yourself. It’s a small experiment about how we interact in a shared digital space. Even though the actions are simple, 
the way the ball moves shows the collective energy of everyone in the room.
